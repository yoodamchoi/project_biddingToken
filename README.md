##Requirements
Looking at the electronic voting process, it can be divided into the voter registration step of creating a list of voters, the step of checking the candidate's agenda, the step of voting, and the counting step. A system is built using blockchain technology so that a series of processes are safely and fairly voted. The built system must meet the requirements. The requirements related to the safety of electronic voting are as follows.
>1. Integrity
Voting is completely conducted from start to finish. It must be accurate and accurately counted.
2. Personalization
Confidentiality must be maintained so that no one can know who the voter is and what he or she voted for. 
3. Impossiblility of double voting
A voter must be able to vote only once. 
4. Right to vote
Only voters who are eligible to vote cannot vote, and must be able to certify their identity. Only one person, one vote is allowed, and no double vote is allowed.
5. Fairness
By making it possible to know the count of votes during the process, It should not have any influence on the vote cast.
6. Verifiability
Voters can check their votes and know if their votes were correctly counted. Anyone can check the vote count, so no one can tamper with the voting results.
